# Repo Structure

The following directories are found in this repo:

- `helm-values`: Broken down into subdirectories by chart, you'll find `values.yaml` files in subdirectories here as referenced by the articles above.
- `images`: Images from the articles (may not be present at first).
- `manifests`: Broken down into subdirectories by chart/product, you'll find a variety of manifests here for various components discussed in the articles. These can be applied by `kubectl apply -f` as needed.
- `talos`: Any Talos linux [configuration](https://www.talos.dev/v1.11/talos-guides/configuration/) patches required from the articles.

# Note

In [Part 6](https://medium.com/itnext/kubernetes-monitoring-a-complete-solution-part-6-visualizing-with-grafana-956499ff4d87), I reference creating a secret. I have not provided a `secret.yaml` in the interest of practicing good security (aka, not commiting secrets to git). Instead, use the command from the article:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic -n victoria-metrics-k8s-stack grafana-admin-password --from-literal=admin-user=admin --from-literal=admin-password=someSecureP@ssWord
```

Make sure you use a better password!
